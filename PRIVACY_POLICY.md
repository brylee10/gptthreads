# GPT Threads Privacy Policy

## Overview
GPT Threads is a Chrome extension that allows users to start conversations with OpenAI's GPT models directly on webpages. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Usage
GPT Threads uses the following information:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Your API key is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage and is never transmitted to our servers. It is only used for calls to the OpenAI API

2. **Highlighted Text and Context**: When you highlight text on a webpage and initiate a chat, the highlighted text and surrounding context are sent to OpenAI's API to generate responses

3. **Chat History**: Your conversations are stored temporarily in your browser's local storage while the webpage is open. This data is cleared when you close the page or tab

4. **Configuration Settings**: Your preferences for the extension (model selection, context settings, interface preferences) are stored locally in your browser

## Data Sharing
- We do not collect, store, or have access to your conversations or API key
- The only data transmitted outside your browser is sent directly to OpenAI via their API using your personal API key
- We do not use analytics services or tracking mechanisms

## Data Security
- Your API key is stored securely using Chrome's built-in storage API.
- All communication with OpenAI's API occurs using HTTPS encryption.
- We do not maintain any servers that store or process your data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated through the extension's update notes.
